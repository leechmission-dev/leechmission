ABOUT

  Leechmission is a fast, easy, and free BitTorrent client. In some
  countries, the dissemination of files like Videos and Music is strictly
  prohibited. However, downloading this content disseminated by someone else
  is not illegal. Leechmission is a solution for anyone who wants to obey
  the local law by disabling sending of content to peers and announcing
  personal files to the tracker.
 
  Visit https://github.com/leechmission-dev/leechmission/wiki for more
  information. 
  
  WARNING:
    * Leechmission does not send any content to peers, so it stays in strict
      violation of BitTorrent protocol idea.
    * Leechmission obeys EU regulations about fair use of Videos and Music. It
      does not send any content to other people, therefore does not violate
      the law. Remember: downloading is legal, uploading means criminal.
    * Leechmission is slower than other BitTorrent clients - with content
      uploading disabled you get really low marks in other peers' queues,
      which blocks your client and don't send you anything.
  
  It comes in several flavors:
    * A native Mac OS X GUI application
    * GTK+ and Qt GUI applications for Linux, BSD, etc.
    * A headless daemon for servers and routers
    * A web UI for remote controlling any of the above

  This project is based on Transmission client, which can be found here:

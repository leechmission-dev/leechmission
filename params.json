{"name":"Leechmission","tagline":"Leechmission - the free Bit Torrent client","body":"### Welcome to the Leechmission Project\r\nLeechmission is a fast, easy, and free BitTorrent client. In some\r\ncountries, the dissemination of files like Videos and Music is strictly\r\nprohibited. However, downloading this content disseminated by someone else\r\nis not illegal. Leechmission is a solution for anyone who wants to obey\r\nthe local law by disabling sending of content to peers and announcing\r\npersonal files to the tracker.\r\n\r\nWARNING:\r\n* Leechmission does not send any content to peers, so it stays in strict violation of BitTorrent protocol idea.\r\n* Leechmission obeys EU regulations about fair use of Videos and Music. It does not send any content to other people, therefore does not violate the law. Remember: downloading is legal, uploading means criminal.\r\n* Leechmission is slower than other BitTorrent clients - with content uploading disabled you get really low marks in other peers' queues, which blocks your client and don't send you anything.\r\n  \r\n### System requirements\r\nThis software is intended to run on Linux machines. It is also possible\r\nto build it for BSD and MacOS, but this feature was not tested. There are\r\nno plans for supporting Microsoft Windows.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is provided \"as is\", without any warranty.
